Waste of time
Won't let me update or scan most QR codes
Does what is expected.
App is super helpful and anyone that says otherwise is a little bit messed up in the brain
It's ok. The only thing I find annoying is it doesn't keep a record of places you're definitely going to be at most days regularly such as workplace. It's kind of annoying if you have to scan in 3 or 4 x in a 24hr period.

I'm very disappointed ð that the New Zealand Covid Tracer App doesn't include the my vaccine pass in the app ð¢ I am brassed off angry ð¤ ð ð¡ and frustrated it's not fair could you please fix it hurry up. Every time â² I go to the verification code it becomes invalid I have to get a new code Every time. ð â¹ð
Slow to start up
this is a joke. you can travel the world an it more strict in New Zealand.
"Nobody likes being tracked, but with covid you need it. Covid is adjusting the world population and eliminating the stupid (anti vaxers)."
"Intuitive, loading speed has improved and so has qr code recognition though it still has difficulty recognizing older crinkled codes."
Sceptical as of COVID is it jus another government controlled trial screen for this day and ages head count in every country???
If the MoH want us to.use this app more how about disabling or shortening their Splash screen at startup. It's frustrating waiting to use the app at a busy location.
Sometimes slow at opening
"The NZ government got this out very quickly in 2020, with privacy and user control over their data at the core of how it works. I have had to install this on hundreds of phones for my customers, and I really appreciate the more recent change that allows users to use the app without logging in immediately."
"Takes a while to scan, other than that it is great!"
if I'm listening to music and open the scanner my phone freezes for 5-15 seconds
I'm only giving it a 5 star because aunty Cindy is cool remember guys spread your legs

Has anybody bothered to tell anyone at Google that their pay app is meant to carry NZ's vaccine pass. Why would we not just use the tracer app instead....
"Doesn't scan codes when I'm out and about, I always have to enter manually."
